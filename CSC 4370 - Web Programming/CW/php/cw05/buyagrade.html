    <h1>Buy Your Way to a Better Education!</h1>

    <p>
      Life itself is your professor, and you are in a state of constant
      learning, now there are 3 kinds of people in the world: people that can
      count and people that can't count. Which of the three are you?. That's
      right! All you need to get a 4.0 in this course. My education is about
      learning what you didn't know even if know you that didn't know.
      <br /><br />

      'Do you need homework today I think so however the moment I forget to
      assign you homework there will be a scholar student to utter loudly 'We
      have homework...'
