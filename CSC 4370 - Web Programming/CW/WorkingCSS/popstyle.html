	<p class="verse bold">
	I've been waiting for sunlight
	I've been searching for love inside
	I've been wanting a new life
	But you are the one who holds it all
	I've been waiting for sunlight
	I've been searching for love inside
	I've been wanting a new life
	But you are the one who holds it all
	</p>
	<p class="chorus bold">
	Oh God!
	Oh God, I'm alone again
	On my knees, I hate the way I'm feeling
	Heaven, take me now
	Oh God, I'm a broken man
	Nothing left for me, and I am pleading
	Heaven, take me now
	</p>
	<p class="verse bold">
	Set me free, yeah!
	Let me bathe in your sunlight
	Take my hand, I'm holding for life
	I've been feeling alone
	For I know you are the one
	Who holds it all
	</p>
	<p class="chorus bold">
	Oh God, I'm alone again
	On my knees, I hate the way I'm feeling
	Heaven, take me now
	Oh God, I'm a broken man
	Nothing left for me, and I am pleading
	Heaven, take me now
	</p>
	<p class="verse bold">
	Now everything is closing
	And this world feels brand new to me
	Closing
	Today, I consider myself
	The luckiest man on the face of the Earth
	I've been given a bad hand
	But I've got an awful lot to live for
	</p>
	<p class="chorus bold">
	Oh God, I'm alone again
	On my knees, I hate the way I'm feeling
	Heaven, take me now
	Oh God, I'm a broken man
	Nothing left for me, and I am pleading
	Heaven, take me now
	</p>
