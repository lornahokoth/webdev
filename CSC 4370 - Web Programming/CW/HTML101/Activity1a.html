    Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little
    control over the way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that
    HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not
    as a way of determining its presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page
    is therefore different from formatting text to appear in a printed document.
