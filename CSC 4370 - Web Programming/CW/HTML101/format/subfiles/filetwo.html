        Users of HTML are sometimes surprised to find that HTML gives them little
        control over the way that a page is displayed. It should be remembered that
        HTML was developed as a means of marking up the structure of a document not
        as a way of determining its presentation. Formatting text to appear on a Web page
        is therefore different from formatting text to appear in a printed document.
